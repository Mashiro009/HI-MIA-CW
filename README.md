# HI-MIA-CONFUSION

This database is a supplemental database to the [HI-MIA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01231v1) wakeup dataset, and we used the same setup of HI-MIA database to further record about 16k audios. The specific text of the audios is the HI-MIA confusion words, and the text details can be found in the paper.

We have applied to openslr for open source.
